If your React frontend is running on http://localhost:3000 
and your Express backend is running on http://localhost:5000, your frontend might face a CORS error when trying to make requests to the backend because the origins don't match. 
Adding app.use(cors()); fixes this issue.

we also need a dynamic route at the backend for the front end



profile picture and dynamic profilefile pucture upload per useri.e thet have ther own folder for file on the backend , back button on user pfrofile, 
users can follow each other and seee each other follow and unfollow,

Pooling


manage application configuration in one module
pass configuration around application

Use models folder for database related operations
// model
users.model.js
findUserById
findUserByUsername


likes.model.js


CORS - limit your requests to your api domain
Group APIs - /api/users /api/admin etc

Start server on a separate function, make it accept multiple ports for tests

Make model functions reusable by using options
function findByUserId(userId, options = { orderBy, sortby }) {
    return pool.query(
        "SELECT * FROM posts WHERE user_id = $1 ORDER BY created_at DESC",
        [userId]
    );
}

need to create some tables
