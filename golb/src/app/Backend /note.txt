If your React frontend is running on http://localhost:3000 
and your Express backend is running on http://localhost:5000, your frontend might face a CORS error when trying to make requests to the backend because the origins don't match. 
Adding app.use(cors()); fixes this issue.

we also need a dynamic route at the backend for the front end
