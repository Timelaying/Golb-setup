rendering or using client resources like storage requires "use client";

cant be jsx if int has functionalities, jsx is only used for resuabel component and renedering

the use of Dynamic routing is important
example

Frontend
 ├── Profile
 │   ├── [username]
 │   │   ├── page.js  <-- This becomes the dynamic profile page
 │   ├── page.js       <-- Keep this if you still want `/profile` for the logged-in user


we need to create components  for frontend
create models for frontend
